Repository Management Scripts

## Script Descriptions

All these scripts are built to work with my current employer, Glia (Salemove). However, they will work for anyone else by changing the organization variable.

### update-repos

Update all local repositories to the latest commit.

### repos-status

Shows a status for repositories. Currently it only supports archived and non-master branch.

### clean-repos

Removes repositories from local directory if they are archived.

### cloc

CLones all non-forked and archived repositories and then counts the line of code in them.

## TODOs

- Combine the individual scripts into a master script.
- Configure to not be fixed for my company
